# Sign-Up-Form
Undertaken in response to the The Odin Project's Intermediate HTML and CSS Course. The prompt for the assignment is [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form).
This assigment is practice with the html pertinent to forms and with some front-end validation of form input.

A live demo of my submission is [here](https://nhsegal.github.io/sign-up-form/).
